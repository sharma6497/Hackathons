Music has been an important part of our lives since time immemorial. Every artist has a signature, making music a subjective art. We have scales/metrics to measure the quality of music. But, is it possible to train a machine learning model to predict the genre and quality of the music?

Currently, many music aggregator applications rely on machine learning to power their recommendation engine, and curate playlists. MachineHack is challenging data scientists and machine learning practitioners to build a highly scalable ML model for a music aggregator app (Company ABC) to accurately predict the genre of songs in the dataset.
